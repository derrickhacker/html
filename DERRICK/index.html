  <h2>MY BIOGRAPHY</h2>
  <h3>My Life History</h3>
  <h4>Title: A Journey Shaped by Love: The Life of DERRICK KIBET</h4>
  <p>Born to devoted parents, Father Evans Kibet and mother Laura Temko, on 28/02/2000, I was destined for a life filled with warmth, compassion, and purpose.</p>
  <p>From the earliest moments of childhood, I was enveloped in an environment of love and guidance. Father Evans, a man of unwavering faith and integrity, instilled in me the values of compassion, humility, and resilience. His gentle demeanor and profound wisdom served as a beacon of inspiration, shaping my character and worldview.</p>
  <p>Equally influential was Mother Laura, a paragon of kindness.</p>
  <p>With aspirations reaching new heights, I enrolled at KCA University, where I pursued a degree in Information Technology (IT). Guided by a relentless drive for excellence and a deep-seated passion for technology, I immersed myself in the complexities of the digital landscape, embracing challenges as opportunities for growth and innovation.</p>
  <p>Throughout my academic journey, the lessons imparted by my parents remained a constant source of inspiration and guidance, instilling within me a profound sense of purpose and determination. I navigated the rigors of university life with grace and resilience, emerging not only with a wealth of knowledge but also with a steadfast commitment to making a meaningful impact in the world.</p>
